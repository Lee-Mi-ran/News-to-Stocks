The bank’s strategists cut the year-end target for the S&P 500 Index to 6,200 from 6,500, implying an 11% gain from Tuesday’s close. The reduction was also in view of declines in the “Magnificent 7” stocks.
“Our revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,” strategists including David Kostin and Jenny Ma wrote in a note dated Tuesday.
Goldman joins a growing chorus of banks that have expressed concerns over economic growth amid heightening geopolitical uncertainties. Analysts at Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc downgraded their views on US equities this week, citing similar worries around the economy and noted better opportunities elsewhere.
Market forecasters at banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and RBC Capital Markets have also tempered bullish calls for 2025.
President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again trade policies and the ongoing government job cuts have sent measures of consumer and business sentiment lower as recession fears mount. The uncertainty has pushed the S&P 500 gauge down by more than 9% from a high in February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbled into correction last week.
Goldman strategists trimmed their earnings growth forecast for the year to 7% from 9% and reduced their price-to-earnings ratio by 4%. Kostin was among analysts who were bullish on US stocks last year and has warned of growth risk to equities in recent weeks.
They said investors should own stocks that are insulated from the major drivers of ongoing market volatility such as lender Bank of New York Mellon Corp., financial information services provider S&P Global Inc., and rating agency Moody’s Corp.
Market participants should also consider stocks hammered by the hedge fund positioning unwind that trade at discounted valuations such as software maker Informatica Inc. and music streaming services provider Spotify Technology SA, they added.

The Bank of Japan is likely to increase the policy rate to 1% this year from the current 0.5% as long as the US economy doesn’t falter, said Masamichi Koike, head of global markets business at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. Beyond that, “I don’t know if it’s in 2026 or 27, but if a time comes where there’s a need to cool the economy or inflation then I think it would have to rise to 2%.”
In turn, benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yields are likely to keep climbing, exceeding 2%, Koike said in an interview. As a result, his bank is holding off on adding large quantities of the notes to its ¥40 trillion ($270 billion) securities portfolio.
“Japan is in a rate-hike cycle,” he said. “If we make a rash move on building up the portfolio now, we could run the risk of bigger valuation losses in the future.”
Traders are closely watching for signs that Japan’s financial institutions will resume buying the nation’s debt now that the central bank has started raising rates and paring its bond holdings.
Koike, 61, has been prescient about rising borrowing costs in Japan in the past, predicting in September 2023 that sticky inflation would drive short- and long-term rates up from rock-bottom levels. The BOJ scrapped its long-standing negative-rate policy six months later, and 10-year bond yields last week breached 1.5% for the first time in 16 years.
Koike’s prediction for the BOJ to potentially raise rates to 2% — a level unseen since 1993 — is more hawkish than the consensus. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate the terminal rate to be 1.25%.
According to Koike, Japan’s inflation will stay above 2%, driven by higher import costs stemming from ructions in global trade. But he doesn’t anticipate major adverse effects from rate hikes, stressing that Governor Kazuo Ueda and his policy board will increase borrowing costs in line with the state of the economy’s health.
“The BOJ will raise rates very carefully to nurture budding inflation,” said Koike, who will become deputy chairman of Japan’s second-largest banking group on April 1. “Economic conditions are improving with a virtuous cycle of wage hikes and inflation. But they’re not so solid that they need cooling down.”"
Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street briefly dips more than 10% below its record,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-mixed-wall-street-045145307.html,Associated Press Finance,2025-03-12 04:51,2025-03-12 13:51,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday as investors weighed the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs after another day of losses on Wall Street.
U.S. futures and oil prices were higher.
Trump's escalation in his trade war briefly pulled the S&P 500 more than 10% below its record set last month. The head-spinning moves came after Trump upped his tariffs against Canadian steel and aluminum, prompting the Canadian province of Ontario to remove a surcharge that had enraged him.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.2% to 36,880.79 in morning trading.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.3% to 23,845.37, while the Shanghai Composite edged down nearly 0.1% to 3,377.95.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.7% to 7,756.90. South Korea's Kospi added 1.5% to 2,575.39.
On Wednesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.8%, taking the main measure of Wall Street’s health to a close 9.3% below its all-time high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1% to 41,433.48. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% to 17,436.10.
Such head-spinning moves are becoming routine in what’s been a scary ride for investors as Trump tries to remake the country and world through tariffs and other policies. Stocks have been heaving mostly lower on uncertainty about how much pain Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants.
“Trump’s tariff policies continue to have a destabilizing effect on markets, with investors left guessing as to which measures will either be added or walked back next,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.
Moves by Trump and comments by the White House on Tuesday didn’t clarify much.
Trump has acknowledged the economy could feel some “disturbance” because of the tariffs he's pushing. Asked on Tuesday just how much pain Trump would be willing for the economy and stock market to take, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to give an exact answer. But she said earlier in the press briefing that “the president will look out for Wall Street and for Main Street.”
For his part, Trump said earlier on social media, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”
Stocks pared their losses later in the day, even briefly eliminating them altogether, after Ontario’s premier said he had agreed to remove the surcharge on electricity that had enraged Trump so much. Trump would afterward say that he would “probably” return the steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada to 25%."

Equity mutual funds raised 56.4 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) in the first two months of the year, a five-fold increase from the same period last year and the biggest amount since 2021, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Morningstar Direct data. The number of such funds launched also jumped 76% year-on-year, the data showed.
The surge in fund inflows underscores growing investor conviction that breakthroughs on the technology front may help counter risks from worsening deflationary pressures and escalation in a trade war with the US. Bullish messages from the just-concluded National People’s Congress also provided investors assurance that Beijing is ready to unveil more stimulus to hit a growth goal of about 5% this year.
Chinese equities have staged a world-beating rally this year thanks to DeepSeek-induced enthusiasm over homegrown artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies. The rally also triggered a strong re-rating of Chinese assets by global money managers including UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
The tech-heavy STAR50 Index climbed more than 9% in the January-February period, while a gauge of tech shares listed in Hong Kong surged nearly 25%.
As investor risk appetite rises, the number of mixed-allocation and bond-focused funds launched recently has fallen out of favor, however. Hybrid funds dropped by 38% in the first two months of 2025 compared to a year ago, while the number of bond funds fell by 29%, according to the data.
The moves were “driven by a combination of the bottoming of long term domestic bond yields and increased optimism in China equities driven by greater confidence in the long term outlook of China’s tech sector,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.

In his own words: Trump takes credit for stock market rises but casts aside blame for sell-off,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/own-words-trump-takes-credit-040955566.html,Associated Press Finance,2025-03-12 04:57,2025-03-12 13:57,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump in recent days has dismissed fears of a recession and brushed aside the stock market sell-off, going so far as to say, “You can’t really watch the stock market."" That's a new message from a leader who has frequently pointed to the market's ups and downs as a reflection of himself and his activities, even when he was not in power.
Over the last year, while President Joe Biden was in office, Trump took credit for stock market rallies as a vote of confidence in his electoral prospects. When the market dipped, he blamed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And he predicted that if Democrats won the 2024 presidential election, the stock market would have crashed.
A look at some of Trump's observations on the stock market over the last year:
Jan. 29, 2024, on Truth Social
“THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET BECAUSE MY POLLS AGAINST BIDEN ARE SO GOOD THAT INVESTORS ARE PROJECTING THAT I WILL WIN, AND THAT WILL DRIVE THE MARKET UP — EVERYTHING ELSE IS TERRIBLE (WATCH THE MIDDLE EAST!), AND RECORD SETTING INFLATION HAS ALREADY TAKEN ITS TOLL. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”
March 12, 2024, on Truth Social
“High Interest Rates and Inflation are choking our great middle class, and ALL, our Economy is bad, and our Stock Market is rising only because Polls are strongly indicating that we will WIN the Presidential Election of 2024.”
April 25, 2024, on his way into court for his criminal trial in New York
“The stock market is, in a sense, crashing. The numbers are very bad. This is Bidenomics. It’s catching up with him. It’s lucky that it’s catching up before he leaves office as opposed to after he leaves office.”
May 15, 2024, on Truth Social
“Thank you to Scott Bessent, one of the Great Prognosticators on Wall Street! There are many people that are saying that the only reason the Stock Market is high is because I am leading in all of the Polls, and if I don’t win, we will have a CRASH of similar proportions to 1929. I agree, but let’s hope we don’t have to worry about that!”
May 18, 2024, at an NRA event in Dallas, Texas:
“We are a nation whose stock market's continued success is contingent on MAGA winning the next election.”
July 16, 2024, on Truth Social
“Dow Jones UP 742 based on the fact that the Market expects a TRUMP WIN in November! Nice compliment — Thank you!”
Aug. 4, 2024, on Truth Social
“STOCK MARKETS CRASHING. I TOLD YOU SO!!! KAMALA DOESN’T HAVE A CLUE. BIDEN IS SOUND ASLEEP. ALL CAUSED BY INEPT U.S. LEADERSHIP!”
Aug. 14, 2024, at a rally in Asheville, North Carolina
“If Harris wins this election, the result will be a Kamala economic crash, a 1929-style depression. 1929. When I win the election, we will immediately begin a brand new Trump economic boom. It’ll be a boom. We’re going to turn this country around so fast. Many people say that they only reason the stock market is up is because people think I am going to win.”"
